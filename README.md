# LunchBuddies

Purpose: The goal of this script is to take in an excel workbook that contains a sheet with 2 lists of names, one list for executive board members and the other 
of general member names. This script will generate x number of additional sheets in the workbook where an executive board name is paired with a general member name, and the priority is to pair executive board members with general members - whichever group has more people will just be paired internally within that group afterward. For the x number of sheets generated, each pairing is unique. That is, a pairing will never be repeated across these x sheets. Each sheet represents one week of a lunch buddies.
